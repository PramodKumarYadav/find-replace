# find-replace
 Goal of project find-replace is to identify/find areas of our society that are broken and give suggestions to replace them with something completely different that you believe can effectively solve the problem in a new and positive way. 
 
 ## Inspiration
 The inspiration for this project came from a linkedin post I saw on 6th of January 2022.  In the post, the schools tried to swap detention for meditation and they found great results. Here is the post. https://www.linkedin.com/posts/world-economic-forum_suspensions-for-fighting-are-down-by-half-ugcPost-6884599401231220736-D8Z3
 
Albert Einstein once said, “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”. There are many "solutions" that are common practice in our society that does not work. Take for example prison system. As per this article, 2/3rd (two third) prisoners will land back in prison within 3 years of their release. https://www.justice.gov/archive/fbci/progmenu_reentry.html. Based on everything that you would have known, heard or seen, you will echo with this sentiment that prisons would do more damage then good to reform a person who lands there. Yet like people who keep landing in the same prisons, over and over again (showing signs of insanity), court rooms, keep sending them again and again to the same prisons, with same practices, over and over again (showing signs of insanity). 

Something should change!

## your turn to find-replace
With this background, I invite you to find an area that you think is broken from ages but is yet never replaced with anything better. Suggest something that you think can be a good replacement for this broken solution (if you can keep it positive, that would be a plus).
