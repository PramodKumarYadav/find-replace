# find-replace
 Goal of project find-replace is to identify/find areas of our society that are broken and give suggestions to replace them with something completely different that you believe can effectively solve the problem in a new and positive way. 
 
 ## Inspiration
 The inspiration for this project came from a linkedin post I saw on 6th of January 2022.  In the post, the schools tried to swap detention for meditation and they found great results. Here is the post. https://www.linkedin.com/posts/world-economic-forum_suspensions-for-fighting-are-down-by-half-ugcPost-6884599401231220736-D8Z3
 
Albert Einstein once said, “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”. There are many "solutions" that are common practice in our society that does not work. Take for example prison system. As per this article, 2/3rd (two third) prisoners will land back in prison within 3 years of their release. https://www.justice.gov/archive/fbci/progmenu_reentry.html. Based on everything that you would have known, heard or seen, you will echo with this sentiment that prisons would do more damage then good to reform a person who lands there. Yet like people who keep landing in the same prisons, over and over again (showing signs of insanity), court rooms, keep sending them again and again to the same prisons, with same practices, over and over again (showing signs of insanity). 

Something should change!

## Your turn to find-replace
With this background, I invite you to find an area that you think is broken from ages but is yet never replaced with anything better. Suggest something that you think can be a good replacement for this broken solution (if you can keep it positive, that would be a plus). For an example, I have add a find-replace suggetion to show the template for adding ideas. You can copy and add another idea below this with your find-replace suggestion. 

## To contribute
Add a new pull request with your idea or add it as an issue in github and I will add it with your name and email. 

## Your idea
- [ ] issue
- [ ] Solution
- [ ] Your reasoning or any other thing that you like to mention.

## Prison system
- [X] Prison system is broken.
- [ ] Instead of court trials, send people to mindfulness centers for a few months. Identify why someone did what they did and how those broken areas can be fixed/healed by redirecting them to places/industries that can let them heal and improve over time. 
- [ ] Why? If the idea of locking people is that they are dangerous to socieity "now", sending them in prison, is only delaying the inevitable. They will be out one day and they may be worse than when they first entered into the prison. Which is exactly what the above article and data shows. 2/3rd of these people did violent crimes "again" against someone new to land back to prison. We need to try out new ideas and see if we can reverse the numbers and not let first time criminals, become repeat criminals. 
- [ ] Note: I realise, this solution is easier said then done. Justice and prison system is a complex matter and trying to dumb it down to a one liner solution is foolish. Yet, so is doing the same things over and over again, expecting different results. You are welcome to add your own suggestion by copy-pasting this block and giving it a number say Prison system -idea 2. Maybe over time, there are enough little ideas that when combined together can make a dent in the system for good. But dont get too stuck with this one topic, I am looking forward for more ideas and suggestions in the list below.
